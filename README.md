# 📘 ECE 657: Starter Assignment Files

Welcome to the starter files repository for **ECE 657: Fundamentals of Machine Learning** at the University of Waterloo. This repository contains the initial materials you’ll need to begin your course assignments.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `assignment2/` – Starter notebook and scaffolding code for Assignment 2  
- `assignment3/` – Starter notebook and scaffolding code for Assignment 3  
- `README.md` – You’re here!

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides partially implemented code to help you get started with each assignment.  
Within each notebook, you'll find `TODO` sections that guide you through the required implementations. These are designed to support your understanding of the concepts taught in class.

## 🧠 Technical Notes

- All code is written in **Python**.
- Some notebooks may require additional libraries such as:
  - [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax)
  - [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
  - [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/)
- Please refer to individual assignment instructions or the course documentation for setup and dependencies.
